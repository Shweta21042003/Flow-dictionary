#FLOW-dictionary

##Project-Aim

Creating a flow project using structs and creating a dictionary for the defined struct.

##Description

In this project I am creating a struct about data of teachers in a school having fields Full Name, Subject taught by them, Years of Experience, Employee ID, email these fields will be the part of struct Details which will be used to create dictionary which will store the value of respective fields in it. Here we will be using Employee ID as a primary key which can be used to retrive all the information related to that Employee ID.

The contract is written in cadence language which I learned from metcrafters in various modules which was a very easy and efficient way to learn cadence to deploy flow contracts.

##Execution

The project is deployed on play.flow which is an test enviornment to deploy and test the contarcts before launching them on the mainnet.

In the given project we first created a contract in the Contract section and defined the whole contract in it the structure dictionary and the functionality to add content to the dictionary is defined in this section, then we have defined the transactions which is used to input values to be stored in the dictionary, and lastly we have defined script ehich allows us to retrivre all details linked to the employee id in the dictionary by giving employee id as input.
